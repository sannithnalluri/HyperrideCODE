                Every user shall have to register themselves on the website of Hypr Ride and also the user needs to submit the soft copies of a driving license and any extra ID proof (Aadhar/PAN/Voter ID).

The users acknowledge that the registered mobile number provided during the registration shall be used for making the requests for services and receiving all communications from the company.

                The payment is done in two types: online on the website and you can also book the vehicle offline from our booking point by UPI and cash. The minimum amount to be paid while booking the vehicle online would be the booking cost, whichever is described to reserve the booking (and you can pay the security deposit). The payment gateway and the other transactional charges will be governed by the government and rules defined by the competent authorities. Any voucher issued by the company will be exclusive of taxes; however, the tax amount will be adjusted in the next booking automatically.
